    <h1 id="HC"> How to Crochet </h1>
    <p> If you are intersted in learning how to crochet, here you'll be able to get to know about the basics of crochet and maybe even start your own project! It may seem hard at first but once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to make a lot of useful or cute items by hand! Don't be afraid to make mistakes as well, with enough practice you'll be able to understand the different stitches and how to read patterns. </p>
    
    <p> Before we start there are a few things you'll need to start crocheting. These items are: a crochet hook, some yarn, a needle, and a pair of scissors. Out of all of these items the two most important are the crochet hook and the yarn. There are various types of hooks and yarn and to make sure the size of your hook matches your yarn, make sure to read the yarn label! Once you know what size hook you'll need, it is recommended that you find a crochet hook with a comfortable handle and the hook is made out of metal because, while there are wooden, plastic, and bamboo hooks, with metal the yarn will be able to glide easier on the hook. </p>
